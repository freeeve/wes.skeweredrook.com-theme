## This is my theme for mongopress
Considering there aren't that many themes in existence for mongopress, maybe there will be some interest.

### Less instead of CSS
I very much enjoy the Less syntax. It makes doing things in CSS more practical. I've included a convenience build file "buildcss", which just compiles the Less into the css/style.css file.

### No longer used
I'm no longer using this theme, so it may have issues with future versions of mongopress that I don't plan to fix.
